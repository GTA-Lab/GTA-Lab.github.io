**Exciting News!**

We are thrilled to announce that we have published two excellent posts on Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) on our GTA-lab website!

**Introduction to Graph Neural Networks**

Our first post, ["Introduction to Graph Neural Networks"](https://gta-lab.github.io/gnn-intro/), provides a comprehensive introduction to GNNs, covering the basics of graph theory, neural networks, and how they intersect. This post is perfect for those new to the field or looking for a refresher on the fundamentals.

**Understanding Graph Neural Networks**

Our second post, ["Understanding Graph Neural Networks"](https://gta-lab.github.io/understanding-gnns/), dives deeper into the world of GNNs, exploring their architecture, training methods, and applications. This post is ideal for those looking to gain a deeper understanding of GNNs and their potential uses.

**Why Republish?**

We forked these excellent posts from Distill.pub to make them available on our website, with the goal of modifying them to better suit our audience's needs. By republishing these posts, we aim to make high-quality content more accessible to our community and provide a foundation for further exploration and discussion.

**Stay Tuned!**

We plan to build upon these foundational posts, creating new content that showcases the applications and advancements of GNNs in various fields. Stay tuned for more exciting updates and announcements from our lab!
